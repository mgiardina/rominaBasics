# Sorting algorithms

Merge and Quick sorting are based on divide and conquer approach with slight differences.

## Merge Sort

The merge sort algorithm divides the array in two equals parts repeatedly until it reaches 1-element array and then merges then comparing right size and the left size of the divided array and combines them into a sorted array.

## Quick Sort

This algorithm uses a pivot element, it can be the last, first or a random element. First step: the array is divided into two subarrays where elements smaller than pivot are position to the right and elements greater than pivot are position to the left. Then pivot element is placed on its correct position.  This process is then repited for the two subarrays and recursevely repited until the array is sorted.
